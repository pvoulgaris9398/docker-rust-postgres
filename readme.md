## docker-rust-postgres
* https://docs.docker.com/language/rust/
* I got the entire example working, including the Kubernetes cluster on my personal laptop. Very cool.
* Next downloaded Postgres SQL to see about adding some data that can be returned by the running web-site.
* Then I want to try to add a simple string to the user-object and see if it gets serialized through, after building, deploying, etc.
